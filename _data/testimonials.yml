He never seemed rushed and always took the time to explain, in detail, the medical situation. I would recommend him to everyone who has any kind of foot problem- he is truly the best!

  description: After two surgeries and multiple doctors, I was at the point where I thought I would always have a 'bad' foot.  During an appointment with yet another new doctor, I was recommended to Dr. Rubin. From the first appointment, Dr. Rubin assured me that he could fix my foot. It took 2 surgeries and 2 years, but I can walk again. Throughout some of the worse days of my life, Dr. Rubin was always supportive, confident, and kind.
